Extension of Android Open Source Project's [ApiDemos app](https://github.com/android/platform_development/tree/master/samples/ApiDemos).
This app demonstrates obtaining and using Device Admin privileges on an Android Device.
Upon obtaining device administrator access (which requires user approval), 
apps can perform sensitive operations such as setting device security policies 
or wiping all apps and data stored on the device. The most important use of this app is to send information from the phone if it is stolen
and someone signs in.
